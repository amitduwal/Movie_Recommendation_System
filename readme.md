# Face Mask Detection

## YOLO v3 Mask Detection

This is a small project on mask detection using yolo_v3. This project was carried out by scraping the photos of people wearing mask in the internet and those photos were labeled using labelImg and a yolo_v3 model was trained on google colab.

## About scripts

- [x] yoloV3_Trainning.ipynb to load darknet and train on data on collab and store model in google drive.




- [x] test_on_video.py to test on current input video stream to the pc.

- [x] plot.py to plot the loss graph
